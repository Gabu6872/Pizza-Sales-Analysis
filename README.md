## Executive Summary
ï»¿Using __SQL__ and __Power BI__, I pulled order status data from the database and created a dashboard in Power BI to visualize the pizza sales. <br>
SQL queries were likewise written to verify the authenticity of the Power BI measures created. <br>
After identifying that the largest revenue opportunity is to increase the sales of large-scale pizzas, I recommend that the management team produce more Large Pizzas than small and medium pizzas. <br> Similarly, it would be essential for the production team to make more pizzas on the weekend, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.
